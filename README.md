# WebApp_for_XSS_Detection
<p align="justify">We have presented an XSS scanner which looks and scans for XSS patterns for a given URL, We use six machine learning models which are trained on XSS Dataset (NormalURL + XSS URL) to predict whether the given URL is safe or unsafe. The results of all these six models is used to calculate the vote (Majority voting) score. Based on the score value and threshold (0.50% > XSS) the decision of whether the given URL is XSS or NON XSS is predicted. This model combined with GUI offers a functional website where users can scan a URL to ensure whether it's safe or unsafe.</p>
